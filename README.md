## ⚡ Getting Started: Bring Your Vision to Life

Follow these simple steps to get the DeeMG-AI application running on your local machine.

### Step 1: Get Your Google Gemini API Key

To power the AI, you need a free API key from Google.

1.  **Visit Google AI Studio**: Go to the [Google AI Studio website](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  **Sign In**: Sign in with your Google account.
3.  **Get API Key**: In the top left, click the `</> Get API Key` button.
4.  **Create Key**: Click `Create API key in new project`. A new key will be generated for you.
5.  **Copy Your Key**: Click the copy icon next to your newly generated key. **Keep this key safe and private!**

### Step 2: Set Up The Project & Add Your API Key

Now, let's get the code and connect it to your API key.

1.  **Download the Code**: Download or clone this project's files to your computer.

2.  **Edit the Service File**: Open the project folder in your favorite code editor (like VS Code) and navigate to the following file:
    `services/geminiService.ts`

3.  **Paste Your API Key**: Inside this file, you will find this code block near the top:

    ```typescript
    if (!process.env.API_KEY) {
      throw new Error("API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }

    const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.API_KEY });
    ```

    You need to **replace** this entire block with the following, pasting your key where it says `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`:

    ```typescript
    // ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Paste your API Key here
    const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"; 

    if (!apiKey || apiKey === "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE") {
        throw new Error("API_KEY is not set. Please open services/geminiService.ts and paste your Google Gemini API key.");
    }

    const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: apiKey });
    ```

    > **🔒 Security Warning:** Never commit this file with your API key to a public repository like GitHub. This method is for local testing only.

### Step 3: Run The App!

This project is set up to run directly in your browser without any complex build steps.

1.  **Open the HTML File**: Navigate to the project folder on your computer and double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).

2.  **(Recommended) Use a Live Server**: For the best experience, open the project folder in VS Code and use the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Right-click on `index.html` and select `Open with Live Server`.

That's it! The DeeMG-AI application should now be running, ready for you to upload your photos and start creating.
